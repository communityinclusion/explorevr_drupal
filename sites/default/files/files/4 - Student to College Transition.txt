>> One of the things that they've noticed is that there are just a lot of other issues that come up outside of the academics which isn't news to anybody.

But they do talk to students a lot about social media, and how do you talk about your disability and how do you connect with your ADA coordinator, and how do you talk to you instructors about your disability and budgeting and how to make healthy decisions now that you're sort of this independent person on a campus where no one's really paying a lot of attention to you? And so they've developed some workshops that they provide to students during; they tacked it onto one of the class times so instead of one day being two hours they turned it into a three-hour class so that students can stay and participate in those workshops.

And so that was something that they came to us and said, hey, listen, this is something that we see and we spend a lot of time doing so how about we make it more formalized and offer some more formal workshops to students on this? My hope is that we can get them into the high schools to work more with high schools because I think the information should really be shared prior to them coming to college.

And we have a lot of high schools that are open to that.

It's finding the mechanism to do it, the way to do it, how to access the students and that sort of thing.

But we're in those conversations now which I think is a really good thing.
