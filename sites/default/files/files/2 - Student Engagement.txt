>> I think what we have found is that we've struggled with getting students to attend.

We've struggled with getting it onto a student's schedule so it's easy for them to remember to go or even know where to go.

Over the last years I think the collaboration has gotten stronger so we're now where they have regular locations where the courses are held and they are at a place now where they are putting it on the student's schedule.

It was not like that up until this year.

There was nothing to remind them that they needed to be there.

They didn't have anything other than their VR counselor telling them to go.

But they have made it so that a student formally registers for the class, or they can have; they can have it put on their schedule by the ADA coordinator.

And that way they're not getting credit for it, but it allows them to see it along with their other classes and understand how it's going to fit into their schedule which increases the chances that they'll actually show up.

Now many students do go and really gain a lot from it, and we have found that for those who do participate they do tend to do a lot better.

Some don't go, but we have found that what they often do is they'll find resources in another way so they might go to just some tutors that are offered at Del Tech to any student, and they're able to pass their classes, and they're doing fine.

And then some folks don't participate, and they don't make it through.

For those who remain engaged with us, we work with them to help them see what other resources might be available.

There could be some sort of certification programs offered at Del Tech that might be a better fit for them, or they might not stay in Del Tech at all and choose to do something else.

But that way VR is still engaged with them and is able to help them, point them in another direction.
