>> So could you share with us a few examples of the kinds of training programs that they have that some of your participants are going through?
>> They do programs in early, early childcare and education.

We have a lot of students, especially students, but I think some of our adults as well.

But a lot of students take the early, early care and education programs.

In fact we had two students who went through our Project Search program in Dover who during Project Search were enrolled at Del Tech at the same time and were using some of the supports from Project Search to complete the course work and they both got jobs in childcare.

They had their internship rotation site in a childcare center at a hospital for Project Search, and then they got jobs in childcare, graduated.

So that's a big one.

I also think there is; I know that there is a lot of manufacturing need down in the lower part of our state, and so Del Tech has developed a manufacturing program for some of the high school students through a career pathway.

They have healthcare for people who are interested in your basic CNA's and what they do is they also can put you on a career pathway track in case you're interested in not just doing your basic CNA but if you would like to continue on and get your LPN and then maybe become an RN.

That's a career pathway track.

So they do some really good training programs for people who have an interest to start off with a certificate and then continue credentialing for certification.
