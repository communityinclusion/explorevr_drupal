Clickpath module for Drupal

** DESCRIPTION **
Clickpath maintains a list of the last pages visited by each user, and can
display those pages in a block. It can also override Drupal's breadcrumb trail
to implement wiki-style "how you got here" breadcrumbs.

** INSTALLATION **

to be available for at Administer >> Configuration and modules >> People and
Permissions >> Permissions.

to set module settings.
